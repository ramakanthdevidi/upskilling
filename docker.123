Why do we need Docker?:

 the code written by software developer was abstracted and bulid as a package and this package as image repo
 
What is Docker?:

  Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use os-level virtuallization to deliver software in packages called containers.


What is container in docker:  

 Docker containers are lightweight packages of software that run on a common platform called Docker Engine.They isolate applications from the underlying system and allow them to run faster, more reliably, and more portably.

what is Docker image: 

  A docker image is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the docker platform


To see docker images we use :  docker images

To see list of coniatiners we use :  docker ps

To pull any images we use: ex:  docker pull mysql


*)Docker hub is is public image repo it is access to any all

we have azure container registry if we want to use in privetly

and also in aws we have elastic container registry.

If we want o remove any docker images which are runnning  we use: docker rmi mysql
for stoped containers we use docker rm containername


If we want to create a container: we use docker create imageid

here u give image id ex:we have 3f8a00f137a0


To see which container created we use: docker ps -a


TO start the contaniner we use : docker start containerid


To login into container we use: docker exec -it 4345ds323r --/bin/bash



Docker Operations:  



imp commands in docker

1) docker --version
2)docker login
3)docker search nginx
4)docker docker inspect image nginx:to see furthor details we use it
5)to see list of images:docker images or docker image ls

6)docker ps : it shows container which are running

or docker ps -a shows all the containers



To create an run the container we use:
   docker run -d --name conatinername imagename

here -d is detached mode means without logining into contanier it it creates and run because some times if we login into container it does not comes back



Docker Networking: we have 3 docker networking 

1)Bridge(default network): run -d --name http01 -p 8080:80 httpd, with port number we can access it 


2)Host:run -d --name http02 --net host httpd, here port number is not required it will acceess direclty

3)None:docker run -d --name http03 --net none httpd , here it is for testing purpousee no one can access it

if want to see the ip adddress of machine we can use : ifconfig 



DOCKER VOLUMES:

default locations for docker volumes are /var/lib/docker/volumes/


how to create volumes: docker run -it --name=srv01 --mount source=testvoll,destination=/data centos

or we can use this also: docker run -it --name srv04 -v testvol1:/data centos


or for attaching exsting volumes to new container we use:
   docker run -it --volumes-from srv01 --name srv02 centos /bin/bash



Docker files:
install apache on centos

pull centos form dockerhub : From

install java : Run

create/opt/tomcat directory : Run

change work directory to /opt/tomcat :wokrdir

download tomcat packages: ADD/RUN

Extract tar.gz file: RUN

Rename To tomcat directory: RUN
