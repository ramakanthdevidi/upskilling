Regions and zones:

high latency: means slow access
azure provide 60+ regions around world

Region :  Specific geographical location to host your resources.


*)In one regions we can have multiple region

*) Each zone have one more datacenters

*) all availability zones in a region are connnected through low-latency links

Note : Not all azure regions have Availability Zones

East US : 3 availability zones

West Central US: 0 


Azure Virtual Machine:

public inbound ports:

1)http(80)
2)https(443)
3)ssh(22)

Availability: are the appliacations available when the user need them?
99.95% availability means 22 min downttime in a month

99.99(four 9's) availability means 4 and halfmin downtime in a month

99.999%(five 9's) availability means 26 sec downtime in a month

for vm's availability based on disk attached 

we are having 
Single instance vm:
  * Premium SSD or ultra Disk: 99.9%
  * standard SSD mangaed Disks: 99.5%
  * Standard HDD Managed Disks: 95%

Availability set: logical grouping of VMs
if  two or more  instances in same availability set : 99.95% here we can see avaialbility incresed.

Virtual Machine Scale Sets:





Server:
The computer system that accepts requests for online files and transmits those files to the client is referred to as a “server” in the context of the Internet.

a simple software program
* A server is a computer porogram or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as client.


managed compute services:

IAAS:   use only infrastructure from cloud provider

ex:Using VM to deploy your applications or databases

you are responsible for :

1. Aplication code and runtime
2. Configuring load balancing
3.Auto scaling
4.os upgrade and patches
5.Availability
ex:vm
ex:on linux os we install java run time and on java run time we deploy applications
this all on on virtual machines

PAAS:  platform as a service

use a platform provided by the cloud

Cloud Provider is responsible for:
    
    Os
    application Runtime
    Auto Scaling Availability & Load balancing\


You are resposible for:
Configuration 
Application

ex:Azure App service
