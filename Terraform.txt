What is a Terraform
*Terraform is an infrastructure as code (iac) tool that allows you to build,change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

variables in Terrafrom:
1.input variable
2)output variable

we have different files for our understanding
1) Provider.tf
2) input.tf
3) output.tf
4) main.tf
5) terraform.tvar

by default we have the name as terraform.tvar but we can change the name to anyone as,

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

What is terraform:

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (iac) tool allows you to build,change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

Components of Terraform:

1.Providers
2.Resources
3.Variables
4.Statefile
5.Provisioners
6.Backends
7.Modules
8.Data Sources
9.Service Principals



1.PROVIDERS :
Terraform relies on pulgins called "Providers" to interact with cloud providers, saas providers, and other APIs.
it is an interaction component for terraform application and infra service


2.RESOURCES : Resources are the most important element in the Terraform language. Each resources block block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.


Variables:

Using variables in terraform configurations makes our deployment more dynamic.


Statefile:

After the deployment is finished terraform creates a state file to  keep track of current state of the infrastructure.
a file name with terraform.tfstate will be created ij oiur working directory.

PROVISIONORS:

similar to configuration management tool like ansible.



Service principal:

it is nothing but for connecting terraform with azure portal

AD->apprigistration
 



to search anything in google type azurerm what you want .


we have to give Permissiions to subscription add the service privilages in it



What is terraform backend:

its nothing but adding Statefile in cloud storage.
